This project was completed under the guidance and supervision of **Dr. Abdallah M. Elsayed**.

## Academic Context

- **Course:** Power System Transmission
- **Grade:** 3rd Grade
- **Department:** Electrical Power Engineering

## Purpose

The primary objective of this calculator is to provide a user-friendly interface for electrical engineering students and professionals to compute essential characteristics of transmission lines. This includes the calculation of inductance and capacitance for various configurations of transmission lines.

## Features

- **Conductor Configuration Selection:** Allows users to choose between different conductor types and arrangements, such as '3-Triangle', '4-Row', '4-Square', '7-Hexagonal', and '9-Square'.
- **Calculation of Inductance and Capacitance:** The tool can calculate the inductance and capacitance values based on the input parameters for different transmission line configurations.
- **Support for Different Phase Configurations:** Includes options for single-phase, three-phase, and two-wire configurations.
- **Adjustment for Bundled Conductors:** The calculator incorporates adjustments for the effective radius in case of bundled conductors.

## Technical Background

The project utilizes MATLAB for its development, leveraging its powerful computational and GUI capabilities. The calculations are based on standard formulas used in the field of power system transmission, with adjustments for self GMD (Geometric Mean Distance) and empirical factors for different conductor arrangements.

## Usage

The tool is straightforward to use, with drop-down menus and input fields guiding the user through the necessary steps to perform calculations. Upon selecting the desired configuration and entering the relevant parameters, the user can compute the inductance and capacitance values by clicking the 'Calculate' button.
